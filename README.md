# Portfolio Projects
A collection of data science projects to demonstrate knowledge and skills.

## [EasyVisa: Automating the Visa Approval Process](https://nbviewer.org/github/rfraissinet/portfolio_projects/blob/main/EasyVisa.ipynb)
- **Goal**: To facilitate the visa application review process by creating a machine learning model to shortlist potential candidates.
- **Outline**:
  - Explored a dataset of visa applications using visualizations to make observations
  - Cleaned the data to prepare for model building
  - Built and tuned several bagging and boosting models to make predictions
  - Identified important features and created a suitable candidate profile
  - Provided insights and recommendations
- **Key skills**: Python (Seaborn, scikit-learn), Data Preprocessing, Bagging (Bagging & Random Forest), Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV
