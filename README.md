# Portfolio Projects
A collection of data science projects to demonstrate knowledge and skills.

## [EasyVisa: Bagging and Boosting to Expedite the Visa Approval Process](https://nbviewer.org/github/rfraissinet/portfolio_projects/blob/main/EasyVisa.ipynb)
- **Goal**: To facilitate the visa application review process by creating a machine learning model that shortlists potential candidates.
- **Outline**:
  - Explored a dataset of visa applications using visualizations to make observations
  - Cleaned the data to prepare for model building
  - Built and tuned several bagging and boosting models to make predictions
  - Identified important features and created a suitable candidate profile
  - Provided insights and recommendations
- **Key skills**: Python (Seaborn, scikit-learn), Data Preprocessing, Bagging (Bagging & Random Forest), Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV

## [Trade&Ahead: Clustering Stocks for Short-term and Long-term Investment](https://nbviewer.org/github/rfraissinet/portfolio_projects/blob/main/Trade%26Ahead.ipynb?flush_cache=true)
- **Goal**: To categorize stocks for different investment approaches with the use of clustering algorithms.
- **Outline**:
  - Explored a dataset of stocks using summary statistics and visualizations to make observations
  - Used K-means and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms to group stocks into clusters
  - Created cluster profiles and provided insight on each cluster
  - Compared the efficacy and usability of both algorithms
  - Distilled findings and gave stock recommendations
- **Key skills**: Python (Seaborn, scikit-learn, SciPy), Data Visualization, K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Cluster Profiling


## [Scraping TSA Data to Determine Best Times to Travel](https://nbviewer.org/github/rfraissinet/portfolio_projects/blob/2a83b83f6138d3d6fedf1a7caad2bceb755e8b73/Scraping_TSA_Data.ipynb)
- **Goal**: To identify airline travel trends by scraping and visualizing TSA checkpoint data 
- **Outline**:
  - Extracted HTML data from TSA's website and parsed the values into a workable format
  - Organized the values into a Pandas dataframe
  - Visualized travel numbers across multiple time frames
  - Identified trends and presented possible explanations
  - Proposed several possible timing approaches to avoid busy travel days
- **Key skills**: Python (BeautifulSoup, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn), Web Scraping, Data Visualization
